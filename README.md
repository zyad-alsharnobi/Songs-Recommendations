# Mood-Based Regional Song Recommender

This project is a **Mood-Based Regional Song Recommender** that leverages a machine learning model to suggest songs tailored to the user's mood and their selected region. The app is deployed using **Streamlit** for an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Mood Detection**: Users input their mood (e.g., happy, sad, energetic, etc.) to receive personalized song recommendations.
- **Regional Preferences**: Users can select a region to get region-specific song recommendations.
- **Machine Learning-Powered**: The app uses a machine learning model to analyze mood and region to generate suggestions.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A clean and modern web application for seamless interaction.

## How It Works
1. The user selects their mood from a dropdown menu or inputs it manually.
2. The user selects a region from the dropdown menu.
3. The app generates a list of songs based on the mood and region, powered by the machine learning model.
